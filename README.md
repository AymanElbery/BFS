BFS is the best choice for unweigted and undirected graph shortest path problem

I have implement two classes :


`Node` class which expresses each node in my graph. <br>
`BFS` class which is contain the main method and main logic of algorithm.

And these are some pictures for inputs and output of run my code:

1) First inputs :

4 3<br>
1 2<br>
1 3<br>
4 2<br>
1 2 1 1<br>
1<br>

2) Second inputs : 

5 4<br>
1 2<br>
1 3<br>
2 4<br>
3 5<br>
1 2 3 3 2<br>
